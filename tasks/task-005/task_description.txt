  Task: Enhance Tasks Routes with Status Updates and Assignment

  Instructions:
  Enhance existing tasks routes by adding status update and assignment capabilities

  1. Add PUT /api/tasks/:id/status - update task status
  2. Add PUT /api/tasks/:id/assign - assign task to user
  3. Add GET /api/tasks/my-tasks - get tasks assigned to current user

  Each endpoint should work with existing task data and enhance task management

  Background:
  The task management system needs better status tracking and user assignment features

  Steps:
  1. Modify existing server/routes/tasks-mock.js file
  2. Add three new task management endpoints
  3. Enhance existing task data structure
  4. Test with the provided test suite

  Expected functionality:
  The status endpoint updates task status with validation
  The assign endpoint assigns tasks to users with validation
  The my-tasks endpoint returns tasks assigned to current user
  Enhanced task data includes status and assignedTo fields
  Better error handling for invalid operations

  Technical requirements:
  - Modify existing tasks-mock.js file (no new files)
  - Use Express.js for routing
  - Return proper HTTP status codes
  - Use consistent JSON response format
  - Include parameter validation

  Success criteria:
  All three new endpoints work correctly
  Existing task functionality remains intact
  Proper error handling for invalid updates/assignments
  Enhanced task data structure

  Critical tested requirements:
  PUT /api/tasks/:id/status with valid status updates task
  PUT /api/tasks/:id/status with invalid status returns error
  PUT /api/tasks/:id/assign assigns task to user
  PUT /api/tasks/:id/assign with invalid user returns error
  GET /api/tasks/my-tasks returns assigned tasks
  GET /api/tasks/my-tasks with no assignments returns empty list
