  Task: Enhance Projects Routes with Filtering and Sorting

  Instructions:
  Enhance existing projects routes by adding filtering and sorting capabilities

  1. Add GET /api/projects/filter - filter projects by status and priority
  2. Add GET /api/projects/sort - sort projects by name, date, or priority
  3. Add GET /api/projects/search - search projects by name or description

  Each endpoint should work with existing project data and return filtered/sorted results

  Background:
  The project management system needs better project discovery and organization features

  Steps:
  1. Modify existing server/routes/projects-mock.js file
  2. Add three new project management endpoints
  3. Enhance existing project data structure
  4. Test with the provided test suite

  Expected functionality:
  The filter endpoint returns projects matching status/priority criteria
  The sort endpoint returns projects sorted by specified field and order
  The search endpoint returns projects matching text search
  Enhanced project data includes status and priority fields
  Better error handling for invalid parameters

  Technical requirements:
  - Modify existing projects-mock.js file (no new files)
  - Use Express.js for routing
  - Return proper HTTP status codes
  - Use consistent JSON response format
  - Include query parameter validation

  Success criteria:
  All three new endpoints work correctly
  Existing project functionality remains intact
  Proper error handling for invalid filters/sorts
  Enhanced project data structure

  Critical tested requirements:
  GET /api/projects/filter?status=active returns active projects
  GET /api/projects/filter?priority=high returns high priority projects
  GET /api/projects/sort?field=name&order=asc returns projects sorted by name
  GET /api/projects/sort?field=date&order=desc returns newest projects first
  GET /api/projects/search?q=test returns projects with "test" in name/description
  GET /api/projects/search with empty query returns all projects
