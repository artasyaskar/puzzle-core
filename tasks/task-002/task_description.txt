  Task: Implement Basic Calculator API for Project Budgets

  Instructions:
  Add calculator endpoints to help with project budget calculations and cost estimations

  1. Create POST /api/calculator/add - sum project costs
  2. Create POST /api/calculator/multiply - calculate total cost with quantity
  3. Create POST /api/calculator/discount - apply discount to project budget

  Each endpoint accepts numbers and returns calculated results

  Background:
  The project management system needs calculator utilities for budget calculations and cost estimations

  Steps:
  1. Create a new route file - name it server/routes/calculator.js
  2. Implement three endpoints for calculator operations
  3. Add the route to server/index-test.js
  4. Test with the provided test suite

  Expected functionality:
  The add endpoint sums multiple numbers: [100, 200, 50] = 350
  The multiply endpoint calculates total: cost 100 * quantity 3 = 300
  The discount endpoint applies percentage: 1000 with 10% discount = 900
  Handle edge cases like empty arrays and zero values
  Validate input format

  Technical requirements:
  - Use Express.js for routing
  - Return proper HTTP status codes
  - Use consistent JSON response format
  - Include basic input validation

  Success criteria:
  All three endpoints work correctly with various inputs
  Proper error handling for invalid inputs
  Clean, readable code following project conventions

  Critical tested requirements:
  POST /api/calculator/add with [100, 200, 50] returns {"result": 350}
  POST /api/calculator/add with [] returns {"result": 0}
  POST /api/calculator/multiply with {"cost": 100, "quantity": 3} returns {"result": 300}
  POST /api/calculator/multiply with {"cost": 50, "quantity": 0} returns {"result": 0}
  POST /api/calculator/discount with {"amount": 1000, "percentage": 10} returns {"result": 900}
  POST /api/calculator/discount with {"amount": 500, "percentage": 0} returns {"result": 500}
