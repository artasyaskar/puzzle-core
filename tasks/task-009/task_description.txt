  Task: Extend Projects API with Advanced Project Management Features

  Instructions:
  Enhance the existing projects endpoints by adding advanced project management functionality to server/routes/projects-mock.js

  1. Add GET /api/projects/:id - get single project details
  2. Add PUT /api/projects/:id - update project details
  3. Add DELETE /api/projects/:id - delete project
  4. Add POST /api/projects/:id/members - add team member to project
  5. Add DELETE /api/projects/:id/members/:userId - remove team member
  6. Add POST /api/projects/:id/status - update project status

  Each endpoint should be added to the existing projects-mock.js file, not create new files

  Background:
  The project management system needs advanced features like detailed project views, member management, and status tracking to support collaborative work

  Steps:
  1. Edit server/routes/projects-mock.js to add 6 new endpoints
  2. Implement project CRUD operations and member management
  3. Test with the provided test suite
  4. All endpoints should use proper authentication and authorization

  Expected functionality:
  The get project endpoint returns full project details: GET /api/projects/123
  The update endpoint modifies project: PUT /api/projects/123 with {"name": "Updated Project"}
  The delete endpoint removes project: DELETE /api/projects/123
  The add member endpoint adds team member: POST /api/projects/123/members with {"userId": "456", "role": "developer"}
  The remove member endpoint removes team member: DELETE /api/projects/123/members/456
  The status endpoint updates project status: POST /api/projects/123/status with {"status": "in-progress"}
  Handle edge cases like non-existent projects, unauthorized access, and invalid member operations
  Use proper input validation and error handling

  Technical requirements:
  - Edit existing server/routes/projects-mock.js file
  - Use existing JWT token system for authentication
  - Add project members array and status field to project model
  - Add role-based access control for member management
  - Return proper HTTP status codes
  - Use consistent JSON response format
  - Include basic input validation
  - Follow existing code patterns in the file

  Success criteria:
  All six new endpoints work correctly with various inputs
  Proper error handling for invalid inputs and unauthorized access
  Clean, readable code following existing project conventions
  Integration with existing auth system

  Critical tested requirements:
  GET /api/projects/123 returns project details with members
  PUT /api/projects/123 with {"name": "Updated"} returns updated project
  DELETE /api/projects/123 returns success message
  POST /api/projects/123/members with member data returns updated project
  DELETE /api/projects/123/members/456 returns updated project
  POST /api/projects/123/status with {"status": "completed"} returns updated project
